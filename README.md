# Matrix Green Rain

![Matrix Green Rain](https://github.com/Skoteinos1/matrix/blob/main/matrix.png)

Project which got me into coding. My Computer Science teacher promised 1 on end of year to student which will write code for "Matrix Green Rain" in Turbo Pascal. He also said it is impossible. I proved him wrong, but he did not keep his word. :/
Unfortunately I couldn't find code I wrote.
